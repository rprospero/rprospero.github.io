Every introductory science student hates unit analysis. I know that I
hated it. After all, you speed an hour calculating the speed of a raft
in a river after a bird lands on it, only to have your teacher mark
dock you a point for writing "10" as opposed to "10 m/s".  It feels
like tedious nitpicking and a cheap way to maintain a curve in the
class.

This is unfortunate, because unit analysis is quite possibly the most
power tool that you can learn in science. It is so powerful, that
you are about to answer a bunch of impossible trivia questions,
despite the fact that I have not even taught you anything yet.

1. How far is it from Parshall, North Dakota to LaGrange, GA?
	1. 1400 miles
	2. 1400 pounds
	3. $1400
	4. 1400 years

2. How much does an average aardvark weigh?
    1. 160 pages
    2. 160 miles per hour
    3. 160°F
	4. 160 pounds

3. At what is the warmest temperature every recorded in Athens, Illinois?
    1. 37 acres
    2. 87 watts
    3. 107°F
    4. 47 gallons

4. For how long did Pharaoh Ramses the VI rule Egypt?
    1. 6000 miles
    2. 3000 days
    3. 9000 ounces
    4. 2000 horse power

The answers are at the end of the post, but you do not really need to
look at them. You already know that you got the answers right. There is
no way that the warmest day in Athens, Illinois was 47 gallons,
because what does that even mean? You have probably never even heard of
the town, but only one of those answers could even possibly be right.
After all, you have never turned into the news to hear the local
meteorologist say that today's high will be 37 acres. But you have
probably encountered someone giving a temperature in Fahrenheit at
some point. So that has to be the right answer, simply because you
know that the others MUST be wrong. That is how unit analysis let you
answer four quiz questions that would have made Ken Jennings punch
Alex Trebek in the face.

Still, this probably does not seem like a big deal. After all, how
often does some one try to tell you that they are thirty feet old?
Well, it turns out that it happens quite a lot. Just this last week, I
had a computer program try to tell me that the distance between the
fibers in the sample I was looking at were 200 per nanometer
apart. Now, even if you are unfamiliar with the nanometer, you have
probably encountered someone measuring how big something is in meters
or kilometers.  Have you ever encounter someone measuring how big
something is in "per meters" or "per kilometers"?  You have not,
because it is impossible.  So, the moment that I saw that the answer
was in "per meters", I knew that the answer was wrong. You now also
know that it is wrong.  You do not know anything about the fibers in my
sample or even what my sample was, but you know that the fibers are
not 200 per nanometer apart. You just out smarted the computer because
you knew unit analysis and it did not. Congratulations!

There is far more to unit analysis than this, which I hope to cover
later, but I hope this gave you some brief insight into how unit
analysis was a powerful tool for understanding the world and not just
a way for vindictive science teachers to punish their students.

For the record, the answers were b,d,c,b
