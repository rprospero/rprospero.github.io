I'm making two posts on this blog today.  Don't expect that to happen
again.  I'm honestly aiming for a weekly schedule on this.

I'm hoping that this blog can contain some interesting notes on
physics, mathematics, and programming. That's the direction that I'm
aiming for at the moment, but it'll wind up going where it goes.
