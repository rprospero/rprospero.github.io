excerpt: One of the first topics that stymies early physics students is vectors. I'm going to attempt to cut through a bunch of the jargon.

One of the first places where people start getting confused in physics
courses is the introduction of vectors.  It doesn't help that the
material is always covered terribly. Some bearded blowhard in a plaid
shirt stands at the front of the room and intones: "Vectors have both
*magnitude* and *direction*". He then starts doing a bunch of
trigonometry problems.  Any time you ask a question or make a mistake,
the teacher declares: "No, that's wrong!  You forgot that vectors have
*magnitude* and *direction*."

We're going to approach it from a different direction.  Let's start by
going back to
[units.](http://rprospero.github.io/2014/06/07/The-beauty-of-unit-analysis.html)
Units were a nice way of marking off numbers to make sure that we know
what we're talking about. When someone tell you to cook something in
the microwave for fifteen feet, you know that that person is an
idiot. We have units that describe how big things are (e.g. feet), how
much things weigh (e.g. pounds), and how much time has passed
(e.g. days). However, let's say I wanted to know where something is?

Let's say we meet on a small island and you're looking for the
bathroom.  You ask if I know where one is and I say "One hundred feet
way".  I'd get a well deserved punch in the face for that, because you
still don't know where the bathroom is.  However, I can still be a
jerk the other way around.  I could point off in some direction and
say "The bathroom is that way", but not mention that it's a ten mile
hike to get there and you'd be better off squatting behind some bush.

If you really want to know where something is, you need both.  I
should point with my hand and say "five miles, that way". There's two
parts to that phrase.  The first part, where I say how far to go, is
the called the *magnitude*.  The second part, where I say which way to
go, is the *direction*.

Now, it's easy to write down "five miles".  I just wrote it.  However,
it's a little harded to write down "that way".  The mathy way of
writing a direction is the letter $$e$$ with a little hat.  I don't
quite know what it's the letter $$e$$: $$\hat{e}$$.  If I come up with
a good mnemonic device to remember that, I'll make a comment here.
Honestly, the letter itself doesn't matter.  In physics, I've seen
$$\hat{x}$$, $$\hat{i}$$, and ever $$\hat{q}$$ at various points, so
don't get too caught up in the letters.  Doesn't really matter right
now.

Getting back to the point, we can now write $$\vec{b} = 5
\hat{e}$$. We've given $$b$$ both a magnitude (5) and a direction
($$\hat{e}$$), so we say that $$b$$ is a vector and put a funny little
arrow over the top, making $$\vec{b}$$.

Great, so now we've got these vectors. What do we do with them?  I'll
save that for next week.
